🧠 Python Quiz Game (Score-Based)

A simple command-line quiz game built using Python, where players answer multiple-choice questions and win points for each correct answer.

📌 Project Description

This project is a basic quiz application that:

Asks multiple-choice questions

Checks the user’s answer

Awards score based on difficulty levels

Displays whether the answer is correct or wrong

It is ideal for Python beginners to understand:

Lists and nested lists

Loops

Conditional statements

User input handling

🚀 Features

Multiple-choice questions

Predefined reward levels

Instant feedback (Correct / Wrong)

Simple and easy-to-understand logic

Runs in the terminal (CLI-based)

🧾 How the Program Works

Questions and options are stored in a list.

Each question has 4 options.

The user enters a number between 1–4.

If the correct option is chosen:

The user wins the reward amount.

If the answer is wrong:

The user loses that level.
